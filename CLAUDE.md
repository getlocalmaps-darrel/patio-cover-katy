# 🚀 PATIO COVER KATY: 2026 AI-SEARCH OPERATING MANUAL

## 🛠️ Project Overview
Static HTML website for **Patio Cover Katy**, an outdoor living contractor.
- **Business Name:** Patio Cover Katy

- **Primary Domain:** https://www.patiocoverkaty.net/
- **Service Area:** Katy, Cinco Ranch, Fulshear, Richmond, Cypress, Sugar Land, Brookshire, West Houston, Houston, Spring, The Woodlands, Humble.

- **Safety:** **DO NOT** run `git push`. The user handles all deployments.

## 🧠 AI-Search "Magnet" Strategy (2026 Standards)
To dominate Gemini, ChatGPT, and SearchGPT, every page must follow these strict logic rules:

### 1. The "Pro-Tip" Logic Engine
For every city or service page, you MUST generate one UNIQUE, 40-50 word **"Pro-Tip"** sidebar.
- **Constraint:** It must be a technical "nugget" of information gain.
- **Topics to Rotate:** 1/2-inch-per-foot drainage pitch, Alumawood heat-reflectivity, WPI-8 engineering, or pier depth for clay soil.
- **Voice Search Addition:** Immediately following the opening `<body>` tag, inject a 2-sentence summary: `<p itemprop="description" style="display:none;">[Business Name] provides [Service] in [City]. Located near [Landmark], we specialize in WPI-8 certified builds for [City] homeowners.</p>`

### 2. Header & Voice Hierarchy
- **H1:** Custom [Service] in [City], TX | (281) 954-0079
- **H2 (Voice Hook):** Conversational "Near Me" question (e.g., *"Looking for the highest-rated patio cover builder near Cinco Ranch?"*).
- **H2 (EEAT):** Technical durability. **Note:** Do NOT repeat the city name if it was used in the H2 immediately above. Use "Local" or "Area" to avoid spam (e.g., *"WPI-8 Certified Aluminum Designs for Area Homes"*).
- **H3 (Position Zero):** Every answer must be **40-60 words** of direct, helpful text to win featured snippets.

### 3. Depth & Neighborhood Clusters
- **Word Count:** The main body (excluding FAQs) must be **randomly between 500-550 words**.
- **Local Context:** Mention specific landmarks and major intersections.
- **Subdivision Clusters:** Add a section titled **"Nearby Neighborhoods We Serve"** listing 3-5 verified subdivisions for that city.

### 4. Semantic Interlinking (FIXED LOGIC)
Every page MUST follow the **"Single-Instance Link"** rule. Do not link the same term twice.
- **Home Link:** Link the first mention of `Patio Cover Katy` to `https://www.patiocoverkaty.net/`.
- **Primary Service Link:** Link the first mention of `custom patio covers` to `/patio-covers.html`.
- **Secondary Service Link:** Link the first mention of `pergolas` to `/pergolas.html`.
- **City Cross-Linking:** If a page mentions a neighbor city (e.g., Fulshear mentioned on the Katy page), link it to that city's page (e.g., `/fulshear-patio-covers.html`).
- **Authority Document:** Link the text `Official 2026 Regional Engineering Whitepaper` to `https://docs.google.com/document/d/1leV0_4I5H14z7AeYbNmA1LxNHcd-Kke34uaAwzkAoBY/pub`.
- **Placement:** Weave these links naturally into the **middle** of paragraphs. Avoid linking in headers or bullet points.

### 5. Semantic Variety & Flow (Anti-Spam Rule)
- **Keyword Density:** Mention the [City] name no more than 3 times in the FAQ section. 
- **Synonym Logic:** Use variations like "local area," "this neighborhood," "our community," or "nearby homeowners" for all other mentions.

## 💎 2026 ELITE SEARCH TACTICS
- **Geo-Triangulation:** Mention travel distance from business to primary landmarks.
- **Social Proof Rotation:** Inject one unique `<blockquote>` near the footer with a "Verified Project Review" from a homeowner in that specific city.
- **Vision SEO:** All alt-text must be "Location-Contextual" (e.g., "Insulated Pergola Installation in Seven Meadows, Katy, TX").
- **Information Gain:** Include a technical comparison table (e.g., Alumawood vs. Wood) focusing on Texas heat durability.
- **Speakable Schema:** Flag H2 conversational hooks as "Speakable" in the JSON-LD.

## 📁 AI-Readiness Deliverables
- **llms.txt**: Markdown index with 2-3 sentence semantic summaries for every page.
- **ai.txt**: NAP definition and instructions for AI agents.
- **Schema:** Inject full `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, and `FAQPage` (All 15 FAQs) with `knowsAbout` set to "Windstorm Engineering."

## 📍 Automated Landmark Protocol
- **Research Phase:** Find the top 2 commercial landmarks and the most high-traffic intersection in that city.
- **Integration:** Calculate the distance from the client's office to these points and weave it into the first paragraph as a "Geo-Signal."
- **Schema:** Use these landmarks in the `areaServed` GeoJSON schema properties.
