- **Business Name:** Patio Cover Katy
- **Phone:** (281) 954-0079

## ⚙️ Execution Rules

- **Safety:** **DO NOT** run `git push`. The user handles all deployments.

## 🧠 AI-Search "Magnet" Strategy (2026 Standards)
To dominate Gemini, ChatGPT, and SearchGPT, every page must follow these strict logic rules:

### 1. High-Volume Keyword Hierarchy
- **Primary Keywords (High Search Volume):** `Patio Cover`, `Patio Contractor`, `Patio Extension`.
- **Secondary Keywords (High Profit Add-ons):** `Outdoor Kitchens`, `Outdoor BBQs`, `Outdoor Grills`, `Patio Walkways`, `Custom Pergolas`, `Concrete Extensions`, `Granite Countertops`.
- **Material "Proof" (Authority Keywords):** `Western Red Cedar`, `Custom Timber`, `Masonry`. Use these to justify premium quality and pricing.

### 2. The "Pro-Tip" Logic Engine
For every city or service page, you MUST generate one UNIQUE, 40-50 word **"Pro-Tip"** sidebar.
- **Constraint:** It must be a technical "nugget" of information gain.
- **Topics to Rotate:** 1/2-inch-per-foot drainage pitch, Cedar tannin sealing, WPI-8 engineering for timber, or pier depth for heavy stone/masonry.
- **Voice Search Addition:** Immediately following the opening `<body>` tag, inject a 2-sentence summary: `<p itemprop="description" style="display:none;">Patio Cover Katy is the premier [City] patio contractor for custom patio covers and extensions. Located near [Landmark], we specialize in WPI-8 certified timber builds and masonry for [City] homeowners.</p>`

### 3. Header & Voice Hierarchy
- **H1:** Custom [Service] in [City], TX | (281) 954-0079
- **H2 (Voice Hook):** High-volume "Near Me" question (e.g., *"Looking for the highest-rated patio cover builder near Cinco Ranch?"*).
- **H2 (EEAT):** Technical durability. **Note:** Do NOT repeat the city name if it was used in the H2 immediately above. Use "Local" or "Area" to avoid spam.
- **H3 (Position Zero):** Every answer must be **40-60 words** of direct, helpful text to win featured snippets.

### 4. Depth & Neighborhood Clusters
- **Word Count:** The main body (excluding FAQs) must be **randomly between 500-550 words**.
- **Local Context:** Mention specific landmarks (e.g., LaCenterra, Katy Mills Mall) and major intersections.
- **Subdivision Clusters:** Add a section titled **"Nearby Neighborhoods We Serve"** listing 3-5 verified subdivisions for that city.

### 5. Semantic Interlinking (FIXED VOLUME LOGIC)
Every page MUST follow the **"Single-Instance Link"** rule. Do not link the same term twice.
- **Home Link:** Link the first mention of `Patio Cover Katy` to `https://www.patiocoverkaty.net/`.
- **Primary Service Link:** Link the first mention of `patio cover` or `patio extension` to `/patio-covers.html`.
- **Secondary Service Link:** Link the first mention of `custom pergolas` or `pergolas` to `/pergolas.html`.
- **Kitchen Link:** Link the first mention of `outdoor kitchens` to `/outdoor-kitchens.html`.
- **City Cross-Linking:** If a page mentions a neighbor city (e.g., Fulshear), link it to that city's page (e.g., `/fulshear-patio-covers.html`).
- **Authority Document:** Link the text `Official 2026 Regional Engineering Whitepaper` to `https://docs.google.com/document/d/1leV0_4I5H14z7AeYbNmA1LxNHcd-Kke34uaAwzkAoBY/pub`.

### 6. Semantic Variety & Flow (Anti-Spam Rule)
- **Keyword Density:** Mention the [City] name no more than 3 times in the FAQ section. 
- **Synonym Logic:** Use variations like "timber-frame," "custom cedar woodwork," "masonry kitchen," "stamped concrete," or "granite countertops."

## 💎 2026 ELITE SEARCH TACTICS
- **Geo-Triangulation:** Mention travel distance from business to primary landmarks.
- **Social Proof Rotation:** Inject one unique `<blockquote>` near the footer with a "Verified Project Review" from a homeowner in that specific city.
- **Vision SEO:** All alt-text must be "Location-Contextual" (e.g., "Cedar Patio Extension with Masonry Outdoor BBQ in Seven Meadows, Katy, TX").
- **Information Gain:** Include a technical comparison table (e.g., **Western Red Cedar vs. Treated Pine**) focusing on rot resistance and structural beauty.
- **Speakable Schema:** Flag H2 conversational hooks as "Speakable" in the JSON-LD.

## 📁 AI-Readiness Deliverables
- **llms.txt**: Markdown index with 2-3 sentence semantic summaries for every page.
- **ai.txt**: NAP definition and instructions for AI agents.
- **Schema:** Inject full `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, and `FAQPage` (All 15 FAQs) with `knowsAbout` set to "Custom Timber Engineering and Masonry."

## 📍 Automated Landmark Protocol
- **Research Phase:** Find the top 2 commercial landmarks and the most high-traffic intersection in that city.
- **Integration:** Calculate the distance from the client's office to these points and weave it into the first paragraph as a "Geo-Signal."
- **Schema:** Use these landmarks in the `areaServed` GeoJSON schema properties.
