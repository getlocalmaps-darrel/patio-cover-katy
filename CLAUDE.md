🚀 PATIO COVER KATY: 2026 AI-SEARCH OPERATING MANUAL
🛠️ Project Overview
Static HTML website for Patio Cover Katy, an outdoor living contractor.

Business Name: Patio Cover Katy

Phone: (281) 954-0079

Service Area: Katy, Cinco Ranch, Fulshear, Richmond, Cypress, Sugar Land, Brookshire, West Houston, Houston, Spring, The Woodlands, Humble.

⚙️ Execution Rules
Environment: Windows 11 / Git Bash. Use unix-style commands (/ slashes).

Workflow: Process exactly 5 pages at a time. Run explorer . and STOP after batch completion.

Safety: DO NOT run git push. The user handles all deployments.

🧠 AI-Search "Magnet" Strategy (2026 Standards)
To dominate Gemini, ChatGPT, and SearchGPT, every page must follow these strict logic rules:

1. The "Pro-Tip" Logic Engine
For every city or service page, you MUST generate one UNIQUE, 40-50 word "Pro-Tip" sidebar.

Constraint: It must be a technical "nugget" of information gain.

Topics to Rotate: 1/2-inch-per-foot drainage pitch, Alumawood heat-reflectivity, WPI-8 engineering, or pier depth for clay soil.

Voice Search Addition: Every page must start with a 2-sentence "AI Speakable Summary" using the itemprop="description" tag (NAP + Service + City) to dominate voice-answer results.

2. Header & Voice Hierarchy
H1: Custom [Service] in [City], TX | (281) 954-0079

H2 (Voice Hook): Conversational "Near Me" question (e.g., "Looking for the highest-rated patio cover builder near Cinco Ranch?").

H2 (EEAT): Technical durability (e.g., "WPI-8 Certified Aluminum Designs for Fulshear Homes").

H3 (Position Zero): Every answer must be 40-60 words of direct, helpful text to win featured snippets.

3. Depth & Neighborhood Clusters
Word Count: The main body (excluding FAQs) must be randomly between 500-550 words.

Local Context: Mention specific landmarks and major intersections.

Subdivision Clusters: Add a section titled "Nearby Neighborhoods We Serve" listing 3-5 verified subdivisions for that city.

4. Semantic Interlinking
One-Link Rule: Exactly one link to 'Patio Cover Katy' (Home) and one link to 'Custom Patio Covers' (Service).

Placement: Weave links naturally into the middle or end of paragraphs.

Authority Document: Link every page to the Official 2026 Regional Engineering Whitepaper.

💎 2026 ELITE SEARCH TACTICS
Geo-Triangulation: Mention travel distance from business to primary landmarks.

Social Proof Rotation: Inject one unique <blockquote> near the footer with a "Verified Project Review" from a homeowner in that specific city.

Vision SEO: All alt-text must be "Location-Contextual" (e.g., "Insulated Pergola Installation in Seven Meadows, Katy, TX").

Information Gain: Include a technical comparison table (e.g., Alumawood vs. Wood) focusing on Texas heat durability.

Speakable Schema: Flag H2 conversational hooks as "Speakable" in the JSON-LD.

📁 AI-Readiness Deliverables
llms.txt: Markdown index with 2-3 sentence semantic summaries for every page.

ai.txt: NAP definition and instructions for AI agents.

Schema: Inject full LocalBusiness, Service, and FAQPage (All 15 FAQs) with knowsAbout set to "Windstorm Engineering".

📍 Automated Landmark Protocol
Research Phase: Find the top 2 commercial landmarks and the most high-traffic intersection in that city.

Integration: Calculate the distance from the client's office to these points and weave it into the first paragraph as a "Geo-Signal".

Schema: Use these landmarks in the areaServed GeoJSON schema properties.
