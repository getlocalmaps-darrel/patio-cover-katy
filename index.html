          <p>
            We're not a big box store that sends out subcontractors. We're a local team that lives and works in the Katy area. We know the soil conditions, the HOA rules in neighborhoods like Cinco Ranch and Firethorne, and exactly what it takes to build structures that survive Houston-area storms.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you call us, you talk to the people who will actually design and build your patio cover. No sales team, no runaround. Just straightforward conversations about what you want and how we can make it happen.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                That depends on what you're looking for. A basic attached patio cover might start around $3,000-$5,000, while a larger solid-roof structure with lighting and fans could run $10,000-$15,000 or more. The best way to get a real number is to have us come out and look at your space. Our estimates are free, and we'll give you options at different price points.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                In most cases, yes. The City of Katy and Harris/Fort Bend counties require permits for structures like patio covers and pergolas. If you're in an HOA neighborhood (and most Katy-area neighborhoods are), you'll also need architectural approval. We handle the permit process and can prepare the drawings your HOA needs.

              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                A patio cover has a solid roof that blocks all sun and rain—think of it like an extension of your house's roof. A pergola has an open or slatted top that lets some light through and creates partial shade. Pergolas have a more open, airy feel; patio covers give you complete weather protection. We build both, and some homeowners even combine them.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer-inner">
                Usually, yes. If your current cover is structurally sound and there's enough space, we can design an outdoor kitchen that fits underneath it. We'll need to look at your gas and electrical access, drainage, and how you want to use the space. Many of our projects involve adding a kitchen to an existing covered area.
